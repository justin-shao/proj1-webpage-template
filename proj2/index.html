        <p>
            In the MeshEdit project, we built Bezier curves and surfaces using de Casteljau algorithm and
            manipulated the meshes by altering their underlying half-edge data structure. Utilizing the functionality
            we built, we were also able to perform loop subdivisions to upsample input meshes.

            Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
        </b>
        <p>
            De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method used to evaluate polynomials that are BÃ©zier curves.
            For each recursive iteration, we iterate through all points and take each of the i<sub>th</sub> and i+1<sub>th</sub> points to calculate a new point using the formula p'<sub>i</sub>(t) = (1-t)*p<sub>i</sub> + t*p<sub>i+1</sub>. After one layer of recursion,
            we will have (total_points-1) number of new points that are used for the next layer of function call.
            The evaluation ends when we produce one singular point from the function call, with the position of that point
            being the position of the Bezier curve evaluated at <code>t</code>.
        </p>

            Given a matrix of <b>n * m</b> control points, we can interpret each of the rows as representing a Bezier curve

            part 1, we will obtain a set of <b>n</b> points, which can then be treated as the control points of another Bezier curve,
            which we will parameterize with <b>v</b> this time.
            Using this process, we get the Bezier surfaces from evaluations across the <b>(u, v)</b> space.

        <b>
            Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.

        <p>
            We keep a "running sum" of the normal vectors, which is initiated to the 0 vector.
            We iterate through the half-edges rooted at the vertex of interest. For each half edge:
            <li>
                Retrieve the locations 3 vertices: the current vertex, the vertext that this half edge points to (h->twin()->vertex()),
                and the vertex that the next half edge points to (h->twin()->next()->twin()->vertex()).
            </li>
            <li>
                Produce 2 vectors from the locations we retrieved in the previous step. Add their cross product to
                the running sum vector. Note that the magnitude of the cross product is proportional to the area of the
                parallelogram formed by the two vectors, which would also be proportional to the area of the triangle.
            </li>
            </br>
            After we iterate through all half-edges rooted at the vertex, we normalize the running sum vector and return it
            as the normal vector of the vertex.

            First, we perform a boundary check, this ensures that we are not flipping a boundary edge.
            Then, we list out all relevant elements by declaring them as local variables - this includes the 6 half-edges, 2 faces, and 4 vertices.
            After that, we "draw out" the new mesh and relabel the half edges accordingly using the <code>HalfEdge::setNeighbors()</code> method.
            Finally, we reassign the half-edge field for each of the vertices and faces to point to a correct half-edge.

            The pointer assignments in general were quite easy to mess up. What ended up helping us was

            While the initial implementation seemed to work fine, we eventually found out that the results from loop subdivisions in the next
            part didn't look quite right. After setting up breakpoints and tracking the upsampling process, we found out that the source of the
            error was actually in part 5 - where our <code>is_new</code> flag was incorrectly set for one of the new edges. The upsampling process
            worked fine after we solved this issue.

            Sharp corners and edges become less noticeable as the loop subdivision smoothes them out. One method of reducing this

            Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.

            The asymetry issue that is observed after subdividing the cube stems from the fact that the original triangularization of the
            cube is asymetric. Observe any face of the cube - the square is split by only one diagonal. This means that the locations of the
            new vertices after the first subdivision will be asymmetric, which then makes the locations vertices after second subdivision to be
            asymmetric, so on so forth.

            To alleviate this issue, we can preprocess the cube by splitting each diagonal edge, which ensures that 
            each face of the cube has symmetric triangularization. This will ensure symmetry of the vertex locations
            after the first subdivision, which then ensures symmetry after the second subdivision, so on so forth.
