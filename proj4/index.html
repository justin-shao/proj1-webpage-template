    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project we implemented a real-time physical simulator on cloth using basic idea of masses and springes. We build data structures that discretely represent the cloth, apply several constraits to the cloth, add some clever tricks to make cloth more realistic, and apply numerical integration eventually to simulate how the cloth moves over time. We also added collision of the cloth with sphere, plane, and also itself to represent scenerios with more than one cloth objects. Finally, during the last part we revisit previous ray tracing ideas for proj3-1 and proj3-2, and apply a much more efficient shader program to generate real-time ray tracing simulation. Although overall simulation is still relatively simple, it is cool to see how GPU can significantly speed up the process of ray tracing using parallel computing. It is cool to implement those shaders that are also fundamental to modern day PC games that present highly complex 3D scenes in real time.</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  </a>
  <p>In this part we build a grid of masses and springs. We create two vectors point_masses and springs to discretely represent the cloth. We create num_width_points * num_height_points of point masses, with increment (width / (num_width_points-1)) on the row axis and (height / (num_height_points-1)) on the column axis. We assign different xyz values based on whether the cloth's orientation is horizontal or vertical. If it is vertical, we define a small random offset using (rand()) / RAND_MAX * 0.002 - 0.001 for the z coordinate. We store the point_masses in a row-major order. After initiating all the point_masses, we loop through each of them to tag whether they are pinned or not.</p>
  <p>After the point_masses are created, we add springs between point_masses to constrain them. There are 3 types of constraits, structural, shearing, and bending. We loop through point_masses three times to add those three constraits. Edges need to be considered separately, such as the first column does not have a structural constraits to its left. The final implementation should be able to show a multiple squares with crosses inside when all three constraits are applied.</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  </a>
  <p>In part 2 we integrate the physical equations of motion into the system of masses and springs to simulate how they move from one time step to the next. We loop through each point mass pm. Before integrating all forces, we first make sure that pm->force is initiate as 0. Then, we first loop through each external acceleration and apply F=ma to this pm's force. Second, we apply the spring connection forces. We check two things, 1) whether the specific constrait is enabled by the ClothedParameter cp; 2) whether this spring's type matches the constrait we are currently looking at. If conditions are met, we compute the force applied to the two point mass using Hooke's law, and considers the direction of the force by ±(positionA - positionB).unit().</p>
  <p>After getting all the forces on each point mass, we loop through each point mass again to use Verlet integration to compute new point mass positions. In Verlet integration velocity times delta_t is approximated by (current_position - last_position). We also add a damping term to velocity to account for loss of energy due to friction etc. For pinned points, we do not change their position at all. </p>
  <p>Finally, we add a smart trick from SIGGRAPH 1995 Provot paper. For each spring, we apply this constraint by correcting the two point masses' positions such that the spring's length is at most 10% greater than its rest_length at the end of any time step. We make sure that we only change the distance between two point masses not the direction by using the magnitude of the difference times the correct direction ±(pA-pB).unit(). If both are not pinned, we apply half of the correction to each point mass. If one is pinned, apply full correction to the other. If both are pinned, do nothing (they are also not moving apart any way).</p>

        <li>damping = 0.046: When damping is small, it takes longer time for the cloth to reach steady.

For small enough damping, the cloth even flips to the other side as shown by the first image. The cloth also falls quicker as low damping means less friction that slows velocity down.</li>
        <li>damping = 0.483: When damping is large, it is usually quicker for the cloth to reach steady because of less or even no back and force shaking and wobbling. However, this is not always the case because the speed of cloth falling down due to gravity is also slower, making it longer to reach balance with gravity force. For a very large damping coefficient, the cloth looks like very slowly falling down a thick air with lots of friction. </li>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  </a>
  <p> 
    In Part3, we implement collision handling for the cloth with a sphere and a plane. The idea is simple, for each collision object in collision_objects, we check that for each point mass in point_masses, whether the point mass's position lies inside the primitive of the object. If this is true, we adjust the point mass's position so that it stays just outside the primitive's surface, accounting for friction as we do so. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul> 
      <li>Sphere: we first check whether the point mass is within the radius by calculating the distance between origin and pm's position. Then, we calculate the tangent point at the surface of the sphere, and calculate the correction that we need to apply to last_position to reach the tangent point. The final poisiton is adjusted by last_position + (1-f) * correction (scale down by friction).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Plane: we first check whether the point mass moves through the plane by calculating the dot product between the surface normal and the previous or current position. If the product of those two dot products are negative, then we say the point crosses through the plane. We "bump" it back up to the side of the surface it originated from by calculating the correction vector needed to be applied to the point mass's last_position in order to reach a point slightly above the tangent point. The final poisiton is also adjusted by last_position + (1-f) * correction (scale down by friction).</li>
    </ul>

  </p>

    <blockquote><b>

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The larger the ks, the more stiff the cloth is. Smaller ks makes the cloth extends longer when resting on the sphere and fiting the sphere shape better. ks represents the stiffness of the cloth (spring), which a larger ks makes the cloth mateiral look more stiff and less flexible when covering a shape.

        t = max(w, h) </code> that the point mass belongs to. The hash function we used is: <code>hash = x*2^14 + y*2^7 + z</code>.

        Tweaking around the <code>density</code> and <code>ks</code> parameters, we found out that both decreasing density
        and increasing spring constant (ks) will result in smoother fabrics as it settles. This makes sense, because the point masses
        are under two types of forces - external gravitational force and spring forces. Since spring forces are what flattens the 
        fabric out, any change to parameters that strengthens the springs (i.e. increasing <code>ks</code>) or weakens external forces
        (i.e. decreasing <code>density</code> which decreases mass of pm) will result in positions with smoother surfaces. \n
        In addition, there are other differences that we observed: lower spring forces (relative to gravitational forces) will 
        result in flat surfaces to be more "bumpy", folds to be rounder, and more ridges (i.e. verticle folds).

    <p>
        GLSL shader programs are isolated programs that can run on GPU cores to perform tasks in the rendering pipeline. Compared to computations done on
        the CPU, running on GPU results in faster rendering as it enables better parralellization.
        For our project, we worked with two types of shaders: vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders perform transformations to the individual
        virdices, like calculating its global position and normal vectors. The outputs from the vertex shaders can then be used as inputs for fragment shaders,
        which perform coloring tasks after rasterization.

    <p>
        The Blinn-Phong shading model incorporates three componenets of lights: ambient light, diffuse light, and specular light.
        <li>The ambient light component is constant across the entire model, providing the basic lighting (and ensures that darker portions of the model can be seen). </li>
        <li>
            The diffuse light component accounts for the diffuse scattering of light, which depends on the distance to the light source
            (contributin to falloff) as well as the normal of the surface (accounts for Lambert's consine Law).
        </li>
        <li>
            Lastly, the specular light component is similar to the diffuse light component as it depends on the normal vector. On top of that, the specular
            light component incorporates a <code>p</code> power term for the consine term, which brings out the highlight effects.
        </li>
        These three components add up produce a shading effect that approximates the real lightin effects quite well.

    <p>
        Looking at the cloth renderings, it is easy to see that both bump mapping and displacement mapping aim to depict texture of the material by
        incorporating height informations. However, when we take a closer look at the renderings (more obvious on spheres), we see that displacement
        mapping modifies the actual geometry of the mesh, while bump mapping only manipulates the normal vectors without altering the mesh.

    <p>
        Comparing the rendering between a high resolution sphere (<code>-o 128 -a 128</code>) and a low resolution sphere (<code>-o 16 -a 16</code>), we observed that the bump mapping method didn't
        have much of a difference. But for displacement mapping, we found that the method can take advantage of the increased resolution (along with some
        tweaking for normal/height parameters) to encode more accurate and realistic height information into the texture.
